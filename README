This is a knockoff of Flood-It (web and ios) I wrote in a few weekends
back in 2009.
Runs in Python 2.x with Pygame.

Has flashy graphics. Built in quake-like console (hit ~ on your keyboard).
My first experiment with a live console in an app.

Runs anywhere Python and Pygame do. Windows .exe created by py2exe
is in deluge_windows.zip. Seems to run on XP, Win Vista, and 7. Let me know
if you have any issues.
